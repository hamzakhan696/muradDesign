          Social Media Influencers and Micro-influencers are having an increasingly bigger impact on
          the success of a company’s advertising campaigns and ROI. Influencers today are the
          modern-day celebrities with a loyal following of fans interested in their stories, ideas,
          and daily routines. In fact, some influencers have a higher following on social media than
          some of the most famous celebrities in the world.

          Some Social Media Influencers usually have one main social media platform or a few that
          they focus on, whilst others might prefer to cross-market themselves on several platforms
          based on their content and their type of target audience.
